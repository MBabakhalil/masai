<h1>b tag</h1>
<p>In HTML 4, set font to boldface where possible. Equivalent CSS: { font-weight: bold; }. The <strong> element usually has the same effect in visual browsers, as well as having more semantic meaning, under HTML 4.01. In HTML5, however, <b> has its own meaning, distinct from that of <strong>. It denotes "text to which attention is being drawn for utilitarian purposes without conveying any extra importance and with no implication of an alternate voice or mood."[30]
B existed in HTML Internet Draft 1.2, and was standardized in HTML 2.0; still current, redefined in HTML5.</p>
<h1>u tag</h1>
<p>In HTML 4, underlined text. Equivalent CSS: { text-decoration: underline; }. Deprecated in HTML 4.01. Restored in HTML5. In HTML5, the <u> element denotes "a span of text with an unarticulated, though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation, such as labelling the text as being a proper name in Chinese text (a Chinese proper name mark), or labelling the text as being misspelt." The HTML5 specification reminds developers that other elements are almost always more appropriate than <u> and admonishes designers not to use underlined text where it could be confused for a hyper-link.[32]
U existed in HTML Internet Draft 1.2, was standardized in HTML 3.2 but was deprecated in HTML 4.0 Transitional and was invalid in HTML 4.0 Strict. Reintroduced in HTML5.</p>
<h1>i tag</h1>
<p>In HTML 4, set font to italic where possible. Equivalent CSS: { font-style: italic; }. Using <em>...</em> has the same visual effect in most browsers, as well as having a semantic meaning as emphasis, under HTML 4.01. (Purely typographic italics have many non-emphasis purposes, as HTML 5 more explicitly recognized.) In HTML5, however, <i> has its own semantic meaning, distinct from that of <em>. It denotes "a different quality of text" or "an alternate voice or mood" e.g., a thought, a ship name, a binary species name, a foreign-language phrase, etc.[31]
I existed in HTML Internet Draft 1.2, and was standardized in HTML 2.0; still current, redefined in HTML5.</p>
